/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a "weather app" that lets users see
basic weather data for any city they desire. The main purpose of
this project was to practice making API calls and pairing it with
async and await. I am developing a greater understanding of
asynchronous JavaScript and how to leverage data from APIs.

/******** Relevant Files *********/

index.html: Basic html skeleton code with simple form elements.

app.js: Simple API call to the OpenWeather API that retrieves
weather data for a specified city and displays it on the page.
